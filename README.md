Software Metrics Calculator
A comprehensive web-based tool for calculating key software metrics, built with React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and integrating the GEMINI API. This tool is designed to help developers and project managers assess the quality, complexity, and maintainability of software projects. It provides insights into various metrics that are crucial for understanding code performance, efficiency, and potential areas for improvement.

Features
Code Complexity Metrics: Calculates cyclomatic complexity, essential for understanding code maintainability and risk.
Code Size Metrics: Includes lines of code (LOC), function counts, and other size-related measures to track project growth.
Code Duplication Metrics: Identifies duplicated code sections, helping you spot areas for refactoring.
Maintainability Index: Provides a numerical value representing the maintainability of the codebase.
Customizable Metric Calculations: Allows developers to define and calculate additional metrics specific to their needs.
Interactive Dashboard: View real-time metrics in a sleek, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
Firebase Integration: Allows project data to be stored and accessed securely using Firebase.
GEMINI API Integration: Connects to the GEMINI API to fetch advanced metrics and data relevant to your project's performance.
Export Metrics: Exports calculated metrics as JSON, CSV, or direct visual reports for easy sharing and analysis.
Installation
To install the software metrics calculator locally:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
Firebase account and Firebase SDK configuration (more details below)
GEMINI API key (you can obtain it from the official GEMINI API documentation)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/maarij07/softwaremetricstool.git
cd softwaremetricstool
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Firebase:

Create a new Firebase project at Firebase Console.
Obtain your Firebase configuration keys from the Firebase Console and create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:
env
Copy code
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
Configure GEMINI API:

Obtain an API key from the GEMINI API.
Add your GEMINI API key to the .env file:
env
Copy code
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Once the application is running:

Enter the path to your project directory in the interface.
The tool will fetch various metrics, calculate them, and display the results in real time.
View and analyze the metrics on the interactive dashboard.
Export the results to CSV, JSON, or generate a visual report.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-name).
Make your changes.
Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-name).
Open a pull request.
Please ensure your changes adhere to the project's style guidelines and include tests where applicable.
